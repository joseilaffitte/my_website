<h1>Challenge 3:GDP components over time and among countries</h1>
<p>At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">Wikipedia GDP page</a>.</p>
<p>The GDP data we will look at is from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads">United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database</a>, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP. The file we will work with is <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6">GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars</a> and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised</p>

<p>What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For both Germany and the US, the calculated GDP was higher than the reported GDP from the 1970’s to the 2000. This difference was highest in the 70’s, of around a 4%, and has steadily decreased over time. Since the 2000’s, both countries report a GDP that is consistent with the sum of its components, thus having an almost 0% deviation.</p>
<p>India on the other hand still has fluctuations on the percentage difference between the reported and calculated GDP. From 1970 until 1990, it reported a lower GDP than its calculated, peaking at a difference of 7.41% in 1979. However, from 1990 until this day, India reports a higher GDP than the sum of its components, except two exceptions in 2007 and 2010. In 2017, the last datapoint available, India’s reported GDP was 2% higher than its calculated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Germany, during the past years, the proportion of their GDP attributed to net exports has increased, while the proportions of all other elements of GDP have decreased. This might be a result of Germany’s strong exports in industries such as automobile, driving the economy of the country. The US has seen a steady increase in the proportion of household spending, reducing government expenditure. Lastly, India has seen a sharp increase in the proportion of gross capital formation, with a decrease in household expenditure. This might suggest an entrepreneurial trend among Indians, who prefer to invest capital than to spend it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, household income is the largest contributor of GDP in all countries, while net exports is the lower. Government expenditure and gross capital formation represent a similar proportion in the US and Germany, while in India gross capital formation appears in a larger proportion.</p>
