# My Life

My name is Jose Laffitte. I was born in Sevilla, Spain, where I lived
most of my life. It is a really beautiful city, and through this

you can take a look at it! When I was 16 I did an exchange to the US,
and at 18 I moved to the Netherlands to complete my university studies.

I come from a big family. We are 6 siblings in total. We are all very
close to each other, which made living with them a lot of fun! There was
never a dull moment in my house growing up! Their names are: - Carlos -
Felipe - Fernando - Luis - Carlota

Now I am beggining to write a new chapter in my life, by moving to
London and starting the MAM Program with a group of great people! I am
**very excited** to get started, and can't wait live great experiences
with the LBS Community!
