# GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. 

The following code reads the excel file and loads the data into a dataframe.

```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

glimpse(UN_GDP_data)
```

As you can see, *waaaaaay* too many rows. The first thing we need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and we must make it into long, tidy format. We will group all years under the same column, as well as change the values to billions of USD. 

```{r reshape_GDP_data}

# cleaning data. Making long grouping years into the same column
tidy_GDP_data = UN_GDP_data %>%
  # select the whole dataframe
  select(1:51) %>% 
      
      # group columns for each year into a long 'year' column, keeping their original         value.
      pivot_longer(cols=4:51,
      names_to="year",
      values_to = "value")


# changing value to Billions of USD
tidy_GDP_data = tidy_GDP_data%>%
  mutate(value = value / 1000000000)

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)

```
Now our dataframe looks **much** better. 

As mentioned above, GDP is formed by a series of indicators. We have selected India, Germany and the US to analyze how these indicators have evolved through the years. The following code explains how we can get a plot to visualize this development. 

```{r}
# We will compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")

# List of indicators of interest. These are stored under the Indicator name column
indicator_list = c("Gross capital formation", 
                   "Exports of goods and services", 
                   "General government final consumption expenditure", 
                   "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)", 
                   "Imports of goods and services")

tidy_GDP_data %>%
  
  # filter by country and indicator name using both lists
  filter(Country %in% country_list)%>%
  filter(IndicatorName %in% indicator_list)%>%
  
  # grouping by indicator
  group_by(IndicatorName)%>%
  
  # plotting
  
  # We use year as our independent variable, and the value of each indicator as our       dependent. We will color color each indicator differently. 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y = value, color=IndicatorName, group=IndicatorName))+
  
  # We plot a line with all indicators
  geom_line(aes(x=year, y = value, color=IndicatorName))+
  
  # We create a separate plot for each contry
  facet_wrap(~ Country)+
  
  # We select a black and white background
  theme_bw()+
  
  # We position the legend vertically and at the bottom
  theme(legend.position="bottom", 
        legend.direction="vertical")+
  
  # We select the scale of our graph
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=seq(1970, 2017, 10))+
  
  # We adjust labels
  labs(title = "GDP Components over time",
         subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",
         x = "", 
         y = "Billion US$")+
  
  # We adjust the name of our legend items
  scale_shape_discrete(
    limits = c(
      "Gross capital formation", 
      "Exports of goods and services", 
      "General government final consumption expenditure", 
      "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)", 
      "Imports of goods and services"),
    labels = c(
      "Gross capital formation", 
      "Exports", 
      "Government expenditure",
      "Household expenditure", 
      "Imports")) +
  NULL
```


Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in our dataframe, it is interesting to also calculate the GDP given its components discussed above. Once we do this, we can check the deviation with the reported GDP to check whether countries accurately report their GDP or not. 

```{r}
# changing tidy_data to wide. De-grouping Indicator names to allow for easier calculations between these. 
UN_GDP_estimation = tidy_GDP_data%>%
  select(1:5)%>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = IndicatorName, 
    values_from = value
  )

# Creation of new column, expected_GDP, which is the result of the euquation provided above to calculate the GDP. 
UN_GDP_estimation = UN_GDP_estimation %>%
  mutate(expected_GDP = 
           UN_GDP_estimation$`Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)`+
           UN_GDP_estimation$`Gross capital formation`+
           UN_GDP_estimation$`General government final consumption expenditure`+
           UN_GDP_estimation$`Exports of goods and services`-
           UN_GDP_estimation$`Imports of goods and services`)

# Creation of new column, percentage deviation, which is the percentage deviation between the expected_GDP column, and the GDP column reported
UN_GDP_estimation = UN_GDP_estimation %>%
  mutate(percentage_deviation = ((expected_GDP/UN_GDP_estimation$`Gross Domestic Product (GDP)`)-1)*100)

# Plot
UN_GDP_estimation %>%
  
  # Filter country in list
  filter(Country %in% country_list)%>%
  
  # We chose year as dependent and deviation in independent
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=percentage_deviation))+
  
  # Line plot of the percentage deviation
  geom_line(group=1, size = 0.8)+
  
  # Baseline at y=0, which is 0% deviation
  geom_line(group=1, y=0, size = 0.8)+
  
  # We create different plots for each country
  facet_wrap(~ Country)+
  
  # We select a black and white background
  theme_bw()+
  
  # We remove the legend
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  
  # We set the scale
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=seq(1970, 2017, 10))+
  
  # We fill the gap between both lines
  
  # If the line is below the baseline means a lower calculated GDP than reported (negative deviation). We fill the gap in red.
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = pmin(0, percentage_deviation), group=1),fill = "red", alpha=0.2) +
  
  # If the line is above the baseline means a higher calculated GDP than reported (positive deviation). We fill the gap in green.
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = percentage_deviation, ymax = pmin(0, percentage_deviation), group=1),fill = "green", alpha=0.2)+
  
  # We adjust the labels
  labs(title = "Deviation of Sum of GDP Components vs Reported GDP",
         subtitle = "Percentage Deviation",
         x = "Year", 
         y = "Percentage Deviation", 
         caption = "Green: Higher Calculated GDP than reported GDP \
         Red: Lower Calculated GDP than reported GDP")+
  NULL

```


> What is the % difference between what we calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

For both Germany and the US, the calculated GDP was higher than the reported GDP from the 1970's to the 2000. This difference was highest in the 70's, of around a 4%, and has steadily decreased over time. Since the 2000's, both countries report a GDP that is consistent with the sum of its components, thus having an almost 0% deviation. 

India on the other hand still has fluctuations on the percentage difference between the reported and calculated GDP. From 1970 until 1990, it reported a lower GDP than its calculated, peaking at a difference of 7.41% in 1979. However, from 1990 until this day, India reports a higher GDP than the sum of its components, except two exceptions in 2007 and 2010. In 2017, the last datapoint available, India's reported GDP was 2% higher than its calculated.



Finally, we can look at the development of the components of GDP as a percentage of a country's total GDP over time. 

```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

```

> What is this last chart telling us?

In Germany, during the past years, the proportion of their GDP attributed to net exports has increased, while the proportions of all other elements of GDP have decreased. This might be a result of Germany's strong exports in industries such as automobile, driving the economy of the country. The US has seen a steady increase in the proportion of household spending, reducing government expenditure. Lastly, India has seen a sharp increase in the proportion of gross capital formation, with a decrease in household expenditure. This might suggest an entrepreneurial trend among Indians, who prefer to invest capital than to spend it. 

Furthermore, household income is the largest contributor of GDP in all countries, while net exports is the lower. Government expenditure and gross capital formation represent a similar proportion in the US and Germany, while in India gross capital formation appears in a larger proportion.
