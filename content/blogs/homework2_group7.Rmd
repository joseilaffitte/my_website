# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r}
weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

For each month and year, the dataframe "weather" shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

```{r}
weather %>% 
  select(1:13) 
```


2. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r}
tidyweather <- weather %>% 
             select(1:13) %>% 
            pivot_longer(cols=2:13,
             names_to="Month",
             values_to = "delta")
tidyweather

```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 



```{r scatter_plot} 
tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies")
```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

>The effect of increasing temperature seem to be more pronounced especially during the winter period, for the months of December, February, January, and  March. 

```{r facet_wrap}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  facet_wrap("Month")+
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies per Month"
  )

```
 

It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculaltes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   
   summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta),  na.rm = TRUE) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth() +
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         

```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that a one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  # choose the interval 2011-present
  filter(Year >=2011)%>% 
  
  summarise(mean = mean(delta,  na.rm = TRUE), SD = sd(delta, na.rm = TRUE), count=n(),
  t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
  SE = SD/sqrt(count),
  margin_error = t_critical * SE,
  lower = mean - margin_error,
  upper = mean + margin_error)

formula_ci

```



```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}
set.seed(12345)

boot_weather <- comparison %>%
  specify(response =delta ) %>%
  generate (reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = c("mean"))

boot_weather_CI <- boot_weather %>%
  get_confidence_interval(level=0.95, type = "percentile")
boot_weather_CI

formula_ci %>%
  select(lower,upper)

boot_weather_CI

```

What does the data show?


>The data gives us very two different confidence intervals for the mean change in temperatures over the years.
The two confidence intervalls  do not overlap, which suggests that one of the method is getting flawed results.
Even if the data is not normally distributed, bootstrapping provides us with a normalised distribution of the mean, meaning that it will be able to correct the skewness of the initial data. However, if the initial sample was flawed, it will mean that the data is distributed around the wrong mean, with a wrong standard deviation. 

# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


In this assignment we analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but we are only interested in very few of these variables and you are using a smaller file.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016?

1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.

```{r}
glimpse(gss)


gss_combined <- gss %>%
  mutate(snapchat = recode(snapchat, "No"=0, "Yes"=1)) %>%
  mutate(instagrm = recode(instagrm, "No"=0, "Yes"=1))%>%
  mutate(snap_insta_temporary = snapchat+instagrm)%>%
  mutate(snap_insta = ceiling(snap_insta_temporary/2))



```


2. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.


```{r}
gss_combined %>%
  summarise(yesses= count(snap_insta==1), noses=count(snap_insta==0), proportion=yesses/noses)

```


3. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram


```{r}
formula_ci_FM <- gss_combined %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  filter(na.rm=TRUE) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(snap_insta,  na.rm = TRUE), SD = sd(snap_insta, na.rm = TRUE), count=n(),
  t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
  SE = SD/sqrt(count),
  margin_error = t_critical * SE,
  lower = mean - margin_error,
  upper = mean + margin_error)

formula_ci_FM
  
```


## Twitter, by education level

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascending order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

1. Turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable. Make sure the order is the correct one and that levels are not sorted alphabetically which is what R by default does. 

```{r}
gss_combined <- gss_combined %>%
  mutate(degree = factor(degree, levels = c("Lt high school", "High School", "Junior college", "Bachelor", "Graduate")))%>%
  arrange(degree)
```

2. Create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree. As before, if the recorded value for either was NA, the value in your new variable should also be NA.

```{r}
gss_combined <- gss_combined %>% 
  mutate(bachelor_graduate = if_else(degree %in% c("Bachelor", "Graduate"), "Yes", if_else(degree %in% c("Lt high school", "High School", "Junior college"), "No", "NA")))

gss_combined
```


3. Calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 

```{r}
gss_twitter <- gss_combined %>%
  filter(bachelor_graduate== "Yes") %>%
  summarise(twitter_yes= count(twitter=="Yes"), twitter_no=count(twitter=="No"), twitter_total=n(), proportion_twitter=twitter_yes/twitter_total, proportion_twitter_no=twitter_no/twitter_total)

proportion_twitter <- as.numeric(gss_twitter["proportion_twitter"])
proportion_twitter_no <- as.numeric(gss_twitter["proportion_twitter_no"])
gss_twitter
```

4. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 
```{r}
formula_ci_twitter <- gss_combined %>% 
  
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes")%>%
  summarise(count = n(),
            SE = sqrt(proportion_twitter*(1-proportion_twitter)/count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            margin_error= t_critical*SE,
            lower = (proportion_twitter - margin_error),
            upper =(proportion_twitter + margin_error))
formula_ci_twitter
```


```{r}


formula_ci_twitter_no <- gss_combined %>% 
  
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes")%>%
  summarise(count = n(),
            SE = sqrt(proportion_twitter_no*(1-proportion_twitter_no)/count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            margin_error= t_critical*SE,
            lower = (proportion_twitter_no - margin_error),
            upper =(proportion_twitter_no + margin_error))

formula_ci_twitter_no
```

Do these two Confidence Intervals overlap?

>The two CIs do not overlap, so we know that there is a significant difference between the two groups, we do not need to run a t-test. 

## Email usage

Can we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly?

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.
```{r}
gss_combined <- gss_combined %>%
          mutate(emailmin = as.numeric(emailmin))%>%
          mutate(emailhr = as.numeric(emailhr))%>%
          mutate(email = emailmin + emailhr*60)

gss_combined
```

2. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical among of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?

```{r}
gss_combined %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = email)) +
  geom_density(fill = "cyan")
  

gss_combined %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(email, na.rm = TRUE), median = median(email,na.rm = TRUE))

gss_combined %>%
  summarise(max=max(email,  na.rm = TRUE), min=min(email,  na.rm = TRUE))
```
>The mean is heavily influenced by outliars(for instance, by skimming the data we can see how Someone  spent 100 hours/week on social media) so we think that the median would be a better measure for the typical amount of time spent on email weekly.


3. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.


```{r}

set.seed(45678)
boot_email <- gss_combined %>%
  specify(response =email ) %>%
  generate (reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = c("mean"))

boot_email_CI <- boot_email %>%
  get_confidence_interval(level=0.95, type = "percentile")
boot_email_CI


boot_email_CI%>%
  mutate(lower_hour = lower_ci%/%60)%>%
  mutate(lower_minute = lower_ci %%60)%>%
  mutate(upper_hour = upper_ci%/%60)%>%
  mutate(upper_minute = upper_ci %%60)

boot_email_CI %>% 
  mutate(lower_hours = floor(lower_ci/60),
         lower_minutes = floor(lower_ci-lower_hours*60),
         lower_time = paste(as.character(lower_hours),"h",as.character(lower_minutes),"min"),
         upper_hours= floor(upper_ci/60),
         upper_minutes = ceiling(upper_ci-upper_hours*60),
         upper_time =paste(as.character(upper_hours),"h", as.character(upper_minutes),("min"))) %>%
         select(lower_time, upper_time)


```

Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.

>We would expect the confidence interval to be wider than the 95% CI. The reason for this lies behind the fact that it comprehends more values than 95%. A 99% CI would provide us with a range of values that we can be 99% (>95%) certain contains the true mean of the population, so it will clearly be wider.

# Biden's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)
```


```{r, cache=TRUE}
approval_weeks <- approval_polllist %>%
          mutate(week=week(mdy(enddate))-3) %>%
          group_by(week) %>%
          select(!enddate) %>%
          select(!startdate) %>%
          mutate(net_approval= approve - disapprove)%>%
          select(!approve)%>%
          select(!disapprove)%>%
          select(!multiversions) %>%
          select(!tracking)%>%
          select(!adjusted_approve)%>%
          select(!adjusted_disapprove)%>%
          select(!timestamp)
approval_weeks
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.
Also, please add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:


```{r}
formula_ci_approval <- approval_weeks %>% 
  
  group_by(week) %>% 

  summarise(count = n(),
            mean = mean(net_approval,na.rm=TRUE),
            SD = sd(net_approval,na.rm=TRUE),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            SE = SD/sqrt(count),
            margin_error= t_critical*SE,
            lower = (mean - margin_error),
            upper =(mean + margin_error))

formula_ci_approval
```

```{r}
formula_ci_approval %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y=mean))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  geom_line(aes(x = week, y=upper), color = "red", size=0.3)+
  geom_line(aes(x = week, y=lower), color = "red", size=0.3)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower,ymax=upper),fill="grey", alpha=0.3)+
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")+
  geom_line(y=0,color = "orange", size=2)+
  labs(
    title= "Approval Margin for Joe Biden ",
    x= "Weeks",
    y= "Net average approval margins "
  )



```



```{r trump_margins, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "biden_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals 

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 4` and `week 25`. Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.
>The CI for week 4 (in our document, recoded to week 1) is [10.42 - 19.29] while the CI for week 25 (in our document, recoded to week 21) is [7.82-11.53]. The first thing that becomes clear is that the width of the CI is different for week 1 (8.87) and 25  (3.71). The reason for this relies in the sample size of the polls: in week 1 there only were 20 polls providing data,against the 46 polls for week 25. The sample of the size influences the CIs also by affecting the SE: as we can see from the table above (formula_ci_approval) the SE week 1 is much higher than for for week 25 (2.119 vs 0.922).


# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on 

```{r}
library(gapminder)
skim(gapminder)
```

- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

You must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")

library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)


countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries
```

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

```{r}

tidy_hiv <- hiv %>% 
             select(1:34) %>% 
            pivot_longer(cols=2:34,
             names_to="year",
             values_to = "hiv")%>% 
              drop_na()
tidy_hiv
skim(tidy_hiv)
```

```{r}

tidy_life_expectancy <- life_expectancy %>%
    select(1:302) %>%
  pivot_longer(2:302,
               names_to="year",
               values_to="life_expectancy") %>%
  drop_na()

tidy_life_expectancy

1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful

```{r}
joined_table %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=hiv,y=life_expectancy))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")+
  facet_wrap(~region)+
  labs(
    title= "Relationship between life expectancy and Hiv diffusion",
    x= "Hiv diffusion, (% population)",
    y ="Life expectancy, years"
  )
  
joined_table %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
```
>The relationship between the two variables shows a negative correlation for each region but for Europe&Centralise Asia: the more HIV is diffused in the region, the lower the life expectancy. 
We checked the data size for the region to try to understand why. In Europe we have 918 data points(the second highest data point per region).We assume say in Europe, people that have been diagnosed by Hiv probably by getting the medication are able to live longer. Very surprising are also the results for Sub-Saharan Africa, where we find a wide range of diffusion of HIV, showing that the diffusion of the illness is very different for each country. Interesting as well is the fact that having HIV in the Middle East and North Africa highly reduces the life expectancy.

2. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful

```{r}
joined_table %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=NY.GDP.PCAP.KD,y=SP.DYN.TFRT.IN))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~region)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  labs(
    title="Relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita",
    y="Fertility rate, kids/women",
    x= "GDP, constant 2010 US$"
  )
```
>We do not see a relationship for  Europe&Central America and for  Middle East & North Africa. However, we do find that the higher the GDP the lower the fertility rate for all other regions.

3. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? Generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.

```{r}
hiv_na <- hiv %>% 
             select(1:34) %>% 
            pivot_longer(cols=2:34,
             names_to="year",
             values_to = "hiv")
hiv_na_country <- left_join(hiv_na, countries, "country"= "country")
              
hiv_na_country

hiv_na_country %>%
  filter(!is.na(region)) %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(na=sum(is.na(hiv)))%>%
  mutate(region=fct_reorder(region, na))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=na,y=region))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(
    title="Number of missing HIV observations per region",
    y="",
    x= "Number of NAs values"
  )
  
```
>Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe& Central Asia have the highest number of observations with missing HIV data.

4. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.

```{r}
endpoints <- joined_table %>%
  group_by(country)%>%

```{r}
prepared_data %>%
  filter(region == region_list[1])%>%
  slice_max(order_by = evolution_of_mortality,n = 5)

5. Is there a relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate?

```{r}
#skim(joined_table)


joined_table %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=SE.PRM.NENR,y=SP.DYN.TFRT.IN))+
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, na.rm=TRUE)+
  theme(axis.title = element_text())+
  facet_wrap(~region)+
  labs (
    title = "Primary school enrollment and fertility rate by region",
    y= "Fertility rate",
    x= "Primary school enrollment, (%) population"
  )

joined_table %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=SE.PRM.NENR,y=SP.DYN.TFRT.IN))+
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, na.rm=TRUE)+
  theme(axis.title = element_text())+
  labs (
    title = "Decreasing fertility rate with increased primary school enrollment",
    y= "Fertility rate",
    x= "Primary school enrollment, (%) population"
  )


```


>Overall, we recognise a clear negativ correlation between the two variables: the higher the primary school enrollment, the lower the fertility rate. Looking at the differences between regions, it becomes clear that the decrease in fertility rate has been more sharp for some regions than for others: In Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin america & Caribbean, fertility rate decreased more than it did in Europe&Central Asia, region in which primary school enrollment has been very high in the analysed timeframe (1960-2016).

# Challenge 1: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"
library(disk.frame)
# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```

We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

> It becomes clear that the effect of national restrictive measures such as lockdowns have greatly influenced the bikes rent. This helps us explain the difference between the average number of rented bikes in May and June 2020 with previous years.

```{r}
actual_bike <- bike %>%
               filter (year >= 2016) %>%
               group_by(year,month) %>%
               summarise(actual = mean(bikes_hired))

expected_bike <- actual_bike %>%
                 group_by(month) %>%
                 summarise(expected = mean(actual))

comparison_bike <- left_join(actual_bike, expected_bike, by = "month")

comparison_bike
```


```{r, tfl_absolute_monthly_change, out.width="100%"}
comparison_bike %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = month, y = actual), color = "black", size = 0.1) +
  geom_line(aes(x = month, y = expected), color = "blue", size = 0.8) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = expected, ymax = pmin(expected, actual)),fill = "red", alpha=0.2)  +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = actual, ymax = pmin(expected, actual)),fill = "green", alpha=0.2)+
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title= "Montly changes in Tfl bikes rentals",
    y="bike rentals",
    x="Months"
  )
```

```{r}
actual_bike_w <- bike %>%
               filter (year >= 2016) %>%
               group_by(year, week) %>%
               summarise(actual = mean(bikes_hired))

expected_bike_w <- actual_bike_w %>%
                 group_by(week) %>%
                 summarise(expected = mean(actual))

comparison_bike_w <- left_join(actual_bike_w, expected_bike_w, by = "week") %>%
                     group_by(week) %>%
                     mutate(dchanges = (actual - expected) / expected )

comparison_bike_w = comparison_bike_w %>%
  filter(!(year ==2021 & week ==53))

```
```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_changemj, out.width="100%"}
comparison_bike_w %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = week, y = dchanges, fill = "black")) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = pmin(0, dchanges)),fill = "red", alpha=0.2)  +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = dchanges, ymax = pmin(0, dchanges)),fill = "green", alpha=0.2)+
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title= "Weekly changes in Tfl bikes rentals",
    y= "Bikes rentals",
    x="Weeks"
  )
```

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?
> In order to calculate the expected rentals we used the mean of rented bikes/montly since we thought this was a better measurement. Since the monthly data of the actual rented bikes does not seem to be heavily right/left skewed, the mean is a good tool to calcukate the expected rentals. If the data were heavily skewed, we would have changed to the median.
